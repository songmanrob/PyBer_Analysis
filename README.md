# PyBer_Analysis
## Challenge
We were tasked with analyzing ride-sharing data from different types of cities (urban, suburban, and rural). During the course of the analysis, we looked at the data grouped by city type. For our final analysis, we followed this same pattern. We figured total rides, total drivers, total fares, the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver, all grouped by the city type as shown.
