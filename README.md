# PyBer_Analysis
## Challenge
We were tasked with analyzing ride-sharing data from different types of cities (urban, suburban, and rural). During the course of the analysis, we looked at the data grouped by city type. For our final analysis, we followed this same pattern. We figured total rides, total drivers, total fares, the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver, all grouped by the city type as shown.

Then, we graphed the total fares by city type over time as shown in this chart.

Obviously, the urban cities, with more rides and more drivers, contribute the most to the overall fare totals. However, uban cities also have the lowest averages for both fare per ride and fare per driver.

I encountered difficulty in getting the latest chart to be labeled properly. With futher time to work on it, I should be able to overcome that obstacle.

I suspect that the higher averages for the rural and suburban rides are due to the length of the ride and smaller supply of drivers. However, I would like to analyze more data to see if this is true. We could use data that show the mileage of the rides, the time-length of the rides, the time drivers have in between rides, and more.
